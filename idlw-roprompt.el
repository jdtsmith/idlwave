;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Advises the appropriate comint function to make the IDL> prompt
;; read-only.  This functionality may be available in future versions
;; of comint directy, in which case this file will be obviated.
;;
;; New versions of IDLWAVE, documentation, and more information
;; available from:
;;                 https://github.com/jdtsmith/idlwave
;;
;; INSTALLATION:
;; =============
;;
;; Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file of the distribution.
;; In short, put this file on your load path and add the following
;; lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
;;             (lambda () (require 'idlw-roprompt)))
;;
;;
;; SOURCE
;; ======
;;
;;   The newest version of this file can be found on the maintainers
;;   web site.
;;
;;     https://github.com/jdtsmith/idlwave
;;
;; DOCUMENTATION
;; =============
;;
;; IDLWAVE is documented online in info format.
;; A printable version of the documentation is available from the
;; maintainers webpage (see under SOURCE)
;;
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS
;; ==============
;;
;; This functionality will probably fail for some future version of
;; comint, given how explicitly
;;
