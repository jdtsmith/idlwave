;; IDLWAVE enables feature-rich development and interaction with IDL,
;; the Interactive Data Language.  It provides a compelling,
;; full-featured alternative to the IDLDE development environment
;; bundled with IDL.

;; See the mode description ("C-h m" in idlwave-mode or "C-h f
;; idlwave-mode") for features, key bindings, and info.
;;
;; New versions of IDLWAVE, documentation, and more information
;; available from:
;;                 https://github.com/jdtsmith/idlwave
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;; ============
;;
;; Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file of the distribution.
;; In short, put this file on your load path and add the following
;; lines to your init file:

;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;; =============
;;
;; IDLWAVE has extensive customize support; to learn about the
;; variables which control the mode's behavior, use `M-x
;; idlwave-customize'.
;;
;; You can set your own preferred values with Customize, or with Lisp
;; code in your init file.  For an example of what to put into your
;; init file, check the TexInfo documentation.
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS:
;; ==============
;;
;;   IDLWAVE support for the IDL-derived PV-WAVE CL language of Visual
;;   Numerics, Inc. is growing less and less complete as the two
;;   languages grow increasingly apart.  The mode probably shouldn't
;;   even have "WAVE" in its title, but it's catchy, and was required
;;   to avoid conflict with the CORBA idl.el mode.  Caveat WAVEor.
;;
;;   Moving the point backwards in conjunction with abbrev expansion
;;   does not work as I would like it, but this is a problem with
;;   Emacs abbrev expansion done by the self-insert-command.  It ends
;;   up inserting the character that expanded the abbrev after moving
;;   point backward, e.g., "\cl" expanded with a space becomes
;;   "LONG( )" with point before the close paren.  This is solved by
;;   using a temporary function in `post-command-hook' - not pretty,
;;   but it works.
;;
;;   Tabs and spaces are treated equally as whitespace when filling a
;;   comment paragraph.  To accomplish this, tabs are permanently
;;   replaced by spaces in the text surrounding the paragraph, which
;;   may be an undesirable side-effect.  Replacing tabs with spaces is
;;   limited to comments only and occurs only when a comment
;;   paragraph is filled via `idlwave-fill-paragraph'.
;;
;;   Determining the expression at point for printing and other
;;   examination commands is somewhat rough: currently only fairly
;;   simple entities are found.  You can always drag-select or examine
;;   a pre-selected region.
;;
;;   When forcing completion of method keywords, the initial
;;   query for a method has multiple entries for some methods.  Would
;;   be too difficult to fix this hardly used case.

(define-derived-mode idlwave-mode prog-mode "IDLWAVE"
  "Major mode for editing IDL source files.

The main features of this mode are

1. Indentation and Formatting
   --------------------------
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.

   To start a continuation line, use \\[idlwave-split-line].  This
   function can also be used in the middle of a line to split the line
   at that point.  When used inside a long constant string, the string
   is split at that point with the `+' concatenation operator.

   Comments are indented as follows:

   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.

   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.

   Use \\[idlwave-fill-paragraph] to refill a paragraph inside a
   comment.  The indentation of the second line of the paragraph
   relative to the first will be retained.  Use
   \\[auto-fill-mode] to toggle auto-fill mode for these
   comments.  When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is
   nil, code can also be auto-filled and auto-indented.

   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the
   entire buffer with \\[mark-whole-buffer] and execute
   \\[idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs].  Then mark the entire buffer
   again followed by \\[indent-region] (`indent-region').

2. Routine Info
   ------------
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the
   accepted keyword parameters of a procedure or function with
   \\[idlwave-routine-info].  \\[idlwave-find-module] jumps to the
   source file of a module.  These commands know about system
   routines, all routines in idlwave-mode buffers and (when the
   idlwave-shell is active) about all modules currently compiled under
   this shell.  It also makes use of pre-compiled or custom-scanned
   user and library catalogs many popular libraries ship with by
   default.  Use \\[idlwave-update-routine-info] to update this
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).

3. Online IDL Help
   ---------------

   \\[idlwave-context-help] displays the IDL documentation relevant
   for the system variable, keyword, or routines at point.  A single
   key stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  See
   the manual to configure where and how the HTML help is displayed.

4. Completion
   ----------
   \\[idlwave-complete] completes the names of procedures, functions
   class names, keyword parameters, system variables and tags, class
   tags, structure tags, filenames and much more.  It is context
   sensitive and figures out what is expected at point.  Lower case
   strings are completed in lower case, other strings in mixed or
   upper case.

5. Code Templates and Abbreviations
   --------------------------------
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\\'.  Some examples:

   \\pr        PROCEDURE template
   \\fu        FUNCTION template
   \\c         CASE statement template
   \\sw        SWITCH statement template
   \\f         FOR loop template
   \\r         REPEAT Loop template
   \\w         WHILE loop template
   \\i         IF statement template
   \\elif      IF-ELSE statement template
   \\b         BEGIN

   For a full list, use \\[idlwave-list-abbrevs].  Some templates also
   have direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.

   \\[idlwave-doc-header] inserts a documentation header at the
   beginning of the current program unit (pro, function or main).
   Change log entries can be added to the current program unit with
   \\[idlwave-doc-modification].

6. Automatic Case Conversion
   -------------------------
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.

7. Automatic END completion
   ------------------------
   If the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' is non-nil, each END typed
   will be converted to the specific version, like ENDIF, ENDFOR, etc.

8. Hooks
   -----
   Turning on `idlwave-mode' runs `idlwave-mode-hook'.

9. Documentation and Customization
   -------------------------------
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use
   \\[idlwave-info] to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does
   not work).  For Postscript, PDF, and HTML versions of the
   documentation, check IDLWAVE's website at URL
   `https://github.com/jdtsmith/idlwave'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

10.Keybindings
   -----------
   Here is a list of all keybindings of this mode.
   If some of the key bindings below show with ??, use \\[describe-key]
   followed by the key sequence to see what the key sequence does.

;;  String normalization ("interning")

;; For the completion and routine info function, we want to normalize
;; the case of procedure names etc.  We do this by "interning" these
;; strings is a hand-crafted way.  Hashes are used to map the downcase
;; version of the strings to the cased versions.  Most *-sint-*
;; variables consist of *two* hashes, a buffer+shell, followed by a
;; system hash.  The former is re-scanned, and the latter takes case
;; precedence.
;;
;; Since these cased versions are really individual lisp objects, we
;; can use `eq' to search (or assq to find in an association list),
;; which is a large performance boost.  All new strings need to be
;; "sinterned".  We do this as early as possible after getting these
;; strings from completion or buffer substrings.  So most of the code
;; can simply assume to deal with "sinterned" strings.  The only
;; exception is that the functions which scan whole buffers for
;; routine information do not intern the grabbed strings.  This is
;; only done afterwards.  Therefore in these functions it is *not*
;; safe to assume the strings can be compared with `eq' and be fed
;; into the routine assq functions.

;; Note that this does not employ the normal obarray/intern method
;; Emacs uses.

;; Here we define the hashing functions.
